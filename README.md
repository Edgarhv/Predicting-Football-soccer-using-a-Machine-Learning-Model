My role is responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. The model that I created helped us as a team to understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. Also, the model gives us more time to work out the specifics related to machine learning in the futures segments.

# First Impression
- We can see that R-squared is equal to 0.691, which means that the regression equation can explain the 69.1% variation in player value.

### Model settings  

- I will add the variable position, and then this position variable will treat as a dummy variable. The midfielder will be labeled as 1; Forward will be labeled as 2; Goalkeeper will be labeled as 3; Defender will be labeled as.


# Segment 2


After defining the variables that we were going to use in our model we needed to encode categorical variables in our data. We used One Hot Encoder from sklearn to encode the player_position variable, obtaininga number per position of a player as shown below:

Attack as 1000 and there are 124 players with this position.
Defender as 0100 and there are 106 players with this position.
Goalkeeper as 0010 and there are 101 players with this position.
Midfield as 0001 and there are only 17 players with this position.

we created a presentation for the final segment. Also, we develop a dashboard
