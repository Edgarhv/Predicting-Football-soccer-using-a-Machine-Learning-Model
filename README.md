In this Project, using multiple linear regression are being estimated market values of the football players in all European teams in the 2018-2019 season.Players from European League will be examined, and we will show the most and the least affecting factors for the market value.

# The reason why we selected this topic?

Nowadays, FIFA is the most important association that governs football federations all over the planet and attracts a lot of fans. Because of its popularity, many football associations obtain huge incomes. Thus, soccer clubs are companies. These companies always make important decisions in relation to who football player they want to employ. It has been a fact that transfers of players make a significant impact on football clubs, cities, countries, and governments. Also, the market value of players provides a budget for these transfers. Therefore, the market value of a player is important to sales and profit for the clubs, which pay attention to analysis and predict player value. So, our question is “ what kind of factors will influence the market value of a player?”
