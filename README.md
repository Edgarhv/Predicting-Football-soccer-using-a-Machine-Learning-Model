My role is responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. The model that I created helped us as a team to understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. Also, the model gives us more time to work out the specifics related to machine learning in the futures segments.

# First Impression
- We can see that R-squared is equal to 0.691, which means that the regression equation can explain the 69.1% variation in player value.

### Model settings  

- I will add the variable position, and then this position variable will treat as a dummy variable. The midfielder will be labeled as 1; Forward will be labeled as 2; Goalkeeper will be labeled as 3; Defender will be labeled as.
